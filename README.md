# Rahi Jamil

## Hey! Iâ€™m Rahi â€” a Fullstack and Backend Engineer who loves building scalable, high-performance apps.

I enjoy working with **Spring Boot microservices**, **Next.js**, and **React** to create web apps that are fast, reliable, and easy to maintain. On the backend, I focus on clean architecture and building microservices that scale. On the frontend, I like crafting smooth, user-friendly interfaces.

I also work a lot with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** to containerize apps and run them in production. Automating deployment with **CI/CD pipelines** is a big part of how I ensure reliable releases.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into distributed systems, event-driven architecture with Kafka, and cloud infrastructure automation.

## What Iâ€™m into these days:

- Building backend microservices with **Spring Boot** and **Spring Cloud**
- Developing modern frontends with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**
- Containerizing apps with **Docker** and running them on **Kubernetes**
- Setting up smooth CI/CD workflows using **GitHub Actions**
- Working with **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** for data storage and caching
- Writing clean, maintainable code focused on performance and scalability
- Learning new stuff every day and contributing to open source when I can
